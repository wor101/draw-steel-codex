 Character Builder:  Building a character step by step.

 TODO::

 OVERALL DESIGN

 The builder uses an MVC approach, as best it can. Its main window is
 the controller, which contains a state object (see MANAGING STATE).
 All interactions with the token or character, like setting values into
 the character, should be executed in events on the controller. There are
 helper functions (see HELPER FUNCTIONS) to make this a little easier.

 Big UI panels are typically lazy-loaded, meaning their UI is not created
 until it is needed.

 RESPONDING TO EVENTS

 The main window in MainPanel.lua handles the __refreshToken__ event.
 In return, it fires the __refreshBuilderState__ event on its entire tree.
 refreshBuilderState is the preferred method to responding to changes
 because it always receives a state object, which contains the token
 and so much more. See MANAGING STATE below.

 MANAGING STATE

 State is managed via a state object that is carried on the main window
 and passed through to all children via FireEventTree("refreshBuilderState", state).
 The State object contains information about the state of the token being
 edited and the rest of the builder, so that is preferable to using any other
 method to obtain this type of data.

 The State object stores data in keys, with a naming convention using dots to
 separate ideas, like "ancestry.selectedId", the currently selected GUID for
 Ancestry in the builder. It's important to note that these are not necessarily
 stored in a table structure. So, while "token" is a key, you cannot use
 state:Get("token.properties") to get the creature on the token. Instead you
 would use state:Get(token).properties.

 Typically you will only need the state object when responding to refreshBuilderState
 and that event always provides it. There is a helper function to get state. See
 HELPER FUNCTIONS below.

 HELPER FUNCTIONS

 There are several helper functions to make it easier for you to do things.
 These helper functions are all managed in this file and aliased as locals in
 the files where they're used.

 The helper functions used most frequently include:

 _fireControllerEvent(eventName, ...)
 Fires an event on the main window / controller. Pass the current UI element.

 _getHero(source)
 Returns the character in the token in the state object. Source can be any UI
 element or the state object. Ensures the object returned is a hero via :IsHero()
 or returns nil.

 _getToken(source)
 Returns the token in the state object. Source can be any UI element or the
 state object.

 OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

 When responding to refreshBuilderState, if your element might not be visible,
 check that first. If it's not visible, then don't bother calculating anything
 else unless it needs to be used elsewhere.
 
 We might consider re-using the choice selection UI - panels built in
 FeatureSelector.lua.

Fantastic peoples inhabit the worlds of Draw Steel. Among them are devils, dwarves, elves, time raiders--and of course humans, whose culture and history dominates many worlds.]]
CharacterBuilder.STRINGS.ANCESTRY.OVERVIEW = [[
Ancestry describes how you were born. Culture (part of Chapter 4: Background) describes how you grew up. If you want to be a wode elf who was raised in a forest among other wode elves, you can do that! If you want to play a wode elf who was raised in an underground city of dwarves, humans, and orcs, you can do that too!

Your hero is one of these folks! The fantastic ancestry you choose bestows benefits that come from your anatomy and physiology. This choice doesn't grant you cultural benefits, such as crafting or lore skills, though. While many game settings have cultures made of mostly one ancestry, other cultures and worlds have a cosmopolitan mix of peoples.]]

CharacterBuilder.STRINGS.CULTURE = {}
CharacterBuilder.STRINGS.CULTURE.INTRO = [[
A hero's culture describes the beliefs, customs, values, and way of life held by the community in which they were raised. This community provides life experiences that give a character some of their game statistics. Even if a hero doesn't share their culture's values, those values shaped their early development and way of life. In fact, some people become heroes primarily from the rejection of the ways of their culture.]]

Being a hero isn't a job. It's a calling. But before you answered that call, you had a different job or vocation that paid the bills. Thank the gods for that, because the experience you gained in that career is now helping you save lives and slay monsters.]]
CharacterBuilder.STRINGS.CAREER.OVERVIEW = [[
Your career describes what your life was before you became a hero. When you select a career, you gain a number of benefits, the details of which are specified in the career's description.]]

CharacterBuilder.STRINGS.CLASS.OVERVIEW = [[
While all your character creation decisions bear narrative weight, none influences the way you play the game like your choice of class. Your class determines how your hero battles the threats of the timescape and overcomes other obstacles. Do you bend elemental forces to your will through the practiced casting of magic spells? Do you channel the ferocity of the Primordial Chaos as you tear across the battlefield, felling foes left and right? Or do you belt out heroic ballads that give your allies a second wind and inspire them to ever-greater achievements?]]

CharacterBuilder.STRINGS.KIT = {}
CharacterBuilder.STRINGS.KIT.INTRO = [[
The knight in shining armor. The warrior priest. The sniper. Censors, furies, shadows, tacticians, and troubadours can tap into these and many more archetypal concepts using kits. A kit is a combination of weapons, armor, and fighting techniques that lets you personalize your martial hero for battle.]]
CharacterBuilder.STRINGS.KIT.OVERVIEW = [[
# Customizing Equipment Appearances
You should absolutely feel free to describe your equipment in a way that makes sense for the story of your game and hero. For instance, if your hero uses a weapon in the whip category as part of their kit, they could use a leather whip, a spiked chain, or a dagger tied to a knotted rope. A hero who wears heavy armor might wear a suit of chain mail, plate armor, or heavy wooden planks tied together. Your choices for equipment aren't limited just to the examples in this book.]]

CharacterBuilder.STRINGS.COMPLICATION = {}
CharacterBuilder.STRINGS.COMPLICATION.INTRO = [[
Beyond the abilities and features bestowed by ancestry and class, your hero might have something else that makes them ... unusual. Perhaps an earth elemental lives in your body. Maybe your eldritch blade devastates enemies but feeds on your own vitality. A complication is an optional feature you can select to enrich your hero's backstory, with any complication providing you both a positive benefit and a negative drawback.]]
