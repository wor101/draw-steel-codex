--- GetTokens: If options is nil, this will return a list of all tokens on the map. Otherwise, will return all the tokens that meet the criteria given in the options. playerControlled = all tokens controlled by players. playerControlledNotShared = all tokens controlled by players, but doesn't include 'party controlled' tokens. haveProperties means tokens that have non-nil CharacterToken.properties. This is largely deprecated since all CharacterTokens should now have properties. unaffiliated means monsters, tokens not controlled by the players or any party. pending refers to tokens that are currently being added but may not have been transferred to the cloud yet (this state should be very brief, less than a second). If position is given, then only tokens within radius of the position will be returned. This function may return an empty list if there are no tokens that match the criteria, but it will not return nil.
